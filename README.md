# Research

This is a repository of personal research projects done in my spare time. These are intended to be purely educational, and not as commerical or production implementations.
I am happy to implement any suggestions or fixes from the public, and hope you have some fun and play around with some of these tools :)

I will upload further documentation in the future to give clearer instructions on how they are intended to be used, otherwise the comments will have to suffice for now.

List of research projects avalible as of 23/08/2022:
- 32 bit texture streaming for unreal, this allows you to send 32bit data from the CPU to the material graph via texture samplers
- Tension Graph, this is a plugin that utilises the Optimus Graph to send vertex motion data through a compute buffer, and output tension data
- TissueNode, this is a maya plugin that is a basic implementation of an amazing nvidia paper you can see here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR5MFQnZM3k. In future I am planning to implement this in compute shaders in Unity or Unreal, the aim being to see if I can get this to run as a fast soft body solution for real time engines.
- Currently I am also writing my own D3D12 engine as part of my personal development, this will also be uploaded here upon completion.

Unfortunatley due to intellectual property clauses, 90% of my personal projects I cannot disclose to the public, as they are too closley related and/or are new propreiatry techniques and not derived from others work. I will upload anything I can here though, but it will be strictly building on the work of others, or projects unrelated to my current role.

Cheers guys :D :D
