# Research

This is a repository of personal research projects done in my spare time. These are intended to be purely educational, and not as commerical or production implementations.
I am happy to implement any suggestions or fixes from the public, and hope you have some fun and play around with some of these tools :)

I will upload further documentation in the future to give clearer instructions on how they are intended to be used, otherwise the comments will have to suffice for now.

Cheers guys :D :D
